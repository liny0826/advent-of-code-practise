# advent-of-code-practise

This repos would hold the code for solving Advent of Code. 

The goal is to learn new languages  with exercises.

Something else might not be achieved by doing Advent Of Code would be:
- Learn Numpy (would probably need to set up something else for that)

Language in list (ambitious, we will see how far we get :) ):
- Python
- Go
- Rust
